Erin Coffey's Python examples.


Hello!
Thank you for reviewing my Python work.

Procedural Python examples:
	available in the /examples folder.

Object oriented examples:
	available in the /examples/OOD folder.

My modules can be found in the /examples/modules folder. 
	Be sure to place them in your local modules location or, 
	copy them into the folder from which you run the examples.

Enjoy :-)
